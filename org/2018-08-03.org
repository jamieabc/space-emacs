** Everytime page enter, re-initialized page
**  Directive `routerLink`

   Behavior of router change is processed by `Router`.

#+BEGIN_SRC browser
<wrapper>
  <a [routerLink] />
<wrapper>
#+END_SRC

   Event is captured by directive `routerLink` and will not be
   propageted further, so outer component will not receive
   this event.

   Need another function for this.
