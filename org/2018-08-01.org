* Sprint Meeting
** Estimation is hard

   Engineer is always optimistic.

** Estimate in unit but not hour

   Hour is hard and different for everyone, some works 8 hours a day
   and some works 12 hours a day. But half day work is same
   to everyone, it makes no bias on that.

** Good estimation is around 70%

   When professional enginner does something not familiar, the
   accuracy of estimation should be around 70%. That's also the reason why
   do team estimation.

* E2E Test
** Difference between unit test & e2e test
   If a behavior exist only within component, then it should be a unit test.

   take `app.e2e.ts` as an example

#+BEGIN_SRC typescript
it('Has title', async () => {});
it('Has header', async () => {});
#+END_SRC

   The `title` and `header` is nothing to do with backend data, so
   these two tests should be writter in unit test. So it will be much
   faster and convenient.
