* Go
** Interface

   Think it as API interface, that different service/object
   communicate with. If some animal looks like a cat, acts like a cat,
   sounds like a cat, then it's a cat. (method signature)

   Every object that provides all necessary method, then it's can be
   viewed as an implementation of specific interface.

   Interface has nothing to do with data, so it needs additional settings.
** Struct

   Sturct has no method inside.
