** go

   I found when jumping definition in go, the message shows "godef: no
   declaration found". After some googling, the error comes from
   missing environment variable of "GOPATH" & "GOROOT". After setting
   these values, everything works normally.

   Use ~M-:~ can type evaluation of lisp.
   Use ~getenv~ to get emacs environemnt variables.
   Use ~setenv~ for emacs environemnt variables.
