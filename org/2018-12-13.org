  Indirect variable reference is supported on bash version >= 2.0, there is a
  easier way to write as follows:

  #+BEGIN_SRC shell
    foo=bar
    var=foo
    echo "${!var}"
  #+END_SRC
  
  For bash version < 2.0, use ~eval~ to do indirect variable reference as
  follows:

  #+BEGIN_SRC shell
    foo=bar
    var=foo
    eval "newvar=\${$var}"
  #+END_SRC
