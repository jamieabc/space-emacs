* Emacs lisp

  [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Backquote.html][reference]]

  Backquote (`) constructs allow you to quote a list, but selectively evaluate
  elements of that list. In the simplest case, it is identical to the special
  form quote (described in the previous section; see Quoting). For example,
  these two forms yield identical results:

  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    `(a list of (+ 2 3) elements)
    ⇒ (a list of (+ 2 3) elements)
    '(a list of (+ 2 3) elements)
    ⇒ (a list of (+ 2 3) elements)
  #+END_SRC
  
  The special marker ‘,’ inside of the argument to backquote indicates a value
  that isn't constant. The Emacs Lisp evaluator evaluates the argument of ‘,’,
  and puts the value in the list structure:
  
  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (a list of ,(+ 2 3) elements)
    ⇒ (a list of 5 elements)
  #+END_SRC
