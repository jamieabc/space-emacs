* ERC 20 Comparison
** Issue

   BM - Asset record + issue record + share record

   SC - ERC 20 create

** Transfer

   BM - Grant record

   SC - ERC 20 transfer

** Swap

   BM - swap record

   SC - Still in consideration, current idea is 3 contracts: A, B, and C. When
   doing swap, contract A and B put tokens into contract C, then contract C do
   the swap, send both records to contract A and B.

* Solidity

  [[https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.5.0/][version 0.5 doc]]

  solidity version matters when compiling contract, e.g. version 0.5 has
  breaking changes so that some old contract cannot exist on that. One way is
  to upgrade contract by newer syntax, the other one is to change compiler version.

  ~openzeppelin-solidity~ has more stars than ~zeppelin-solidity~, so I change
  to use former one.

** Balance

   [[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48558766/two-ways-of-getting-balance-in-solidity][reference]]

   Use map to store balances, key-value pair, default to 0.

* Truffle

** Abbreviation

   BN: BigNumber

** Clean start

   #+BEGIN_SRC shell
     truffle migrate --reset --network development --compile-all
   #+END_SRC
