** Issue

   BM - Asset record + issue record + share record

   SC - ERC 20 create

** Transfer

   BM - Grant record

   SC - ERC 20 transfer

** Swap

   BM - swap record

   SC - Still in consideration, current idea is 3 contracts: A, B, and C. When
   doing swap, contract A and B put tokens into contract C, then contract C do
   the swap, send both records to contract A and B.
