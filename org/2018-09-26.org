* Python

  When running `aws-shell`, an error message has shown

  #+BEGIN_QUOTE
  -bash: /usr/local/bin/aws-shell: /usr/local/opt/python/bin/python2.7: bad interpreter: No such file or directory
  #+END_QUOTE

  From [[https://christianfei.com/posts/Fix-Python-2-7-issue-on-OSX-bad-interpreter/][reference]], setup symbolic link

  #+BEGIN_SRC shell
  ln -s /usr/local/bin/python /usr/local/opt/python/bin/python2.7
  #+END_SRC

  After doing that, still has some proble, so I uninstall the
  `aws-shell` and using `brew` to install

  #+BEGIN_SRC shell
  pip uninstall aws-shell
  brew install aws-shell
  #+END_SRC
